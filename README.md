# Data Analysis with R Specialization (Coursera, Duke University)

This repository contains labs, assignments, and project files for the [**Data Analysis with R Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) on Coursera, offered by **Duke University**. The specialization consists of three core courses that guide through the fundamental topics in statistics and data analysis using R. Below is an overview of the repository's structure.

## 1. Introduction to Probability and Data with R
